### Migrations

[Sequelize migrations](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/tutorial/migrations.html)



### Postgres

If you have Docker installed you can easily start a Postgres container to run your database ([reference])(https://hackernoon.com/dont-install-postgres-docker-pull-postgres-bee20e200198)
. In order to keep the data persistant across container restarts you need to mount a folder to store the data in. Creating a folder (absolute path needed) and start the container:

```sh
mkdir -p $HOME/.docker-data/postgres
docker run --rm --name pg-letterfromhumanity -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -d -p 5432:5432 -v $HOME/.docker-data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres
```

Now you can connect by connecting to postgres://postgres:docker@localhost:5432/postgres ðŸŽ‰
